# Inorder Successor in Binary Search Tree

## Problem

Given a binary search tree (BST) and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return ```null```.

Definition of BST:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary trees.
- A single node tree is a BST.

In-order traversal: Left -> Root -> Right
