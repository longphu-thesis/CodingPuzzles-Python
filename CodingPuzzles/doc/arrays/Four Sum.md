Given an array S of n integers, are there elements *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* in *S* such that *a + b + c + d = target*?
 
 Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.
 
 Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

*Notice*

Elements in a quardruplet (*a,b,c,d*) must be in non-descending order. (ie, *a<=b<=c<=d*)
The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

**Example**

Given array S = ```{1 0 -1 0 -2 2}```, and target = ```0```. A solution set is:

```
(-1, 0, 0, 1)
(-2, -1, 1, 2)
(-2, 0, 0, 2)
```
