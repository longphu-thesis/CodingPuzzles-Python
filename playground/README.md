Here are some puzzles I collected from work.

Some were asked by my colleague, and I'd love to think and solve them, to see if I can come up with some good solutions ;-)

Some were what I asked other people including interviewees. I try to solve them myself to see if I make the same mistakes as some of them did ;-)

These puzzles are memories. Behind them were the conversation I enjoyed.
