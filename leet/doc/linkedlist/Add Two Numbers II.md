You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in ```forward``` order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

# Thoughts

Example
Given ```6->1->7 + 2->9->5```. That is, ```617 + 295```.

Return ```9->1->2```. That is, ```912```.
